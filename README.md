# IdeasHubAppn
D    escription
The system to be created will need to allow users to book space in the ideas hub. The booking will take one of two forms, and either be a private booking of the whole room, or a hot desk booking for a particular space within the room. If the room has a private booking, users will not be allowed to book the room for a hot desk space, and if there is a hot desk space booked, users will not be allowed to book the room for a private booking.

The system will need the following features:nn

*User Login 
*Booking management
  *Add booking
  *Delete booking
  *View current bookings
*Calendar view to show the bookings of the room
*The ability to specify whether the booking is private or a single desk

It has been decided that the system will be created as a responsive website. 

The site will need the following screens:
*Login
*View all bookings
*Add booking
*View personal bookings Preview
*View specific booking when clicked (Including delete button)
